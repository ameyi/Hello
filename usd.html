<h1>Why the US dollar is the most used currency in the world?</h1>
<p style="color: rgba(238, 255, 0, 0.842)">
Dollar diplomacy was created by president William Howard Taft from 1909-1913. Taft's dollar diplomacy generally encouraged business in the carribean. Later, the Taft administration engineered such a policy in Nicaragua. Taft and his secretary of state (Philander C. Knox) attempted to promulgate dollar diplomacy in China, but that wasn't successful. Later, president Wilson decided to not adopt the dollar diplomacy and instead, intended that U. S. foreign policy should "support and nurture democracy throughout the world," rather than focus on economic policies. Anyways, the US dollar has been the world's most important currency since the end of WWII. The US dollar is now the world's most common reserved currency. It is the most used currency in international trading and transaction. The US dollar makes up more than 60% of the world's reserved currency, but how did it GET THERE? Well, back in 1944, a conference was held called the Bretton Woods Conference. 44 countries had agreed to a world bank and the IMF (International Monetary Fund). This actually was created to avoid depressions like the one that struck the US from 1929-1939. There were minor issues in the 1960s that were solved by Richard Nixon in the 70s. This led to the Smithsonian agreement, which devalued the dollar and allowing exchanged rates to fluctuate more, but that lasted temporarily. Soon, the US dollar had gained a lot more value than it once had. However, there still issues with Russia and China trying to use currency manipulation on the United States and also trying to "get rid of it."
